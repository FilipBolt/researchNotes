  abstract = {This paper presents a method of extract-ing argumentative structure from natural language text. The approach presented is based on the way in which we under-stand an argument being made, not just from the words said, but from existing contextual knowledge and understanding of the broader issues. We leverage high-precision, low-recall techniques in order to automatically build a large corpus of infer-ential statements related to the text's topic. These statements are then used to produce a matrix representing the inferential rela-tionship between different aspects of the topic. From this matrix, we are able to determine connectedness and directional-ity of inference between statements in the original text. By following this approach, we obtain results that compare favourably to those of other similar techniques to classify premise-conclusion pairs (with re-sults 22 points above baseline), but with-out the requirement of large volumes of annotated, domain specific data.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a comparative analysis of the performance of different supervised machine learning methods and feature sets on argument mining tasks. Specifically, we address the tasks of extracting argu-mentative segments from texts and pre-dicting the structure between those seg-ments. Eight classifiers and different com-binations of six feature types reported in previous work are evaluated. The results indicate that overall best performing fea-tures are the structural ones. Although the performance of classifiers varies depend-ing on the feature combinations and cor-pora used for training and testing, Random Forest seems to be among the best per-forming classifiers. These results build a basis for further development of argument mining techniques and can guide an im-plementation of argument mining into dif-ferent applications such as argument based search.},

@article{Ajjour2017,
abstract = {The segmentation of an argumentative text into argument units and their non-argumentative counterparts is the first step in identifying the argumentative structure of the text. Despite its importance for argument mining, unit segmentation has been approached only sporadically so far. This paper studies the major parameters of unit segmentation systematically. We ex-plore the effectiveness of various features, when capturing words separately, along with their neighbors, or even along with the entire text. Each such context is reflected by one machine learning model that we evaluate within and across three domains of texts. Among the models, our new deep learning approach capturing the entire text turns out best within all domains, with an F-score of up to 88.54. While structural fea-tures generalize best across domains, the domain transfer remains hard, which points to major challenges of unit segmentation.},

Research questions:
- features for argumentation segmentation
- best machine learning model for segmentation
- generalization across domains for segmentation

Three main methods: SVM, CRF and Bi-LSTM

Across domain is a problem, definition of argument units do not match across corpora (unfortunately)

Dataset
Essays -- Argument Annotated Essays Corpus includes 402 persuasive essays from essayforum.com by students
Web discourse - Habernal Toulmin annotated text

Features
Semantic features -- words (embeddings didn't work)
Syntactic - POS tags
Structural Features -- use Stanford parser for sentences, clauses, phrases
Pragmatic features -- Penn discourse treebank

Models
- Reimplementation of CRF gets worse results (4{\%}) using structural, syntatic, lex-syn and prob feature sets using CRF-suite
- SVM that doesn't have any context
- linear chain-CRF with a 5-size window
- LSTM with word embeddings as tokens + all other feature sets as a one-hot encoded vector
LSTM is best displayed by figure 2, in total there is one for semantic features (embeddings), one for all others, and then one for the outputting labels to model inter-label dependency

Comparison to previous work
- randomly split the test set of the essay corpus and use t-test to compare F-scores across the subset},
