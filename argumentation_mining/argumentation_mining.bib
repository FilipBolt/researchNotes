  abstract = {This paper presents a method of extract-ing argumentative structure from natural language text. The approach presented is based on the way in which we under-stand an argument being made, not just from the words said, but from existing contextual knowledge and understanding of the broader issues. We leverage high-precision, low-recall techniques in order to automatically build a large corpus of infer-ential statements related to the text's topic. These statements are then used to produce a matrix representing the inferential rela-tionship between different aspects of the topic. From this matrix, we are able to determine connectedness and directional-ity of inference between statements in the original text. By following this approach, we obtain results that compare favourably to those of other similar techniques to classify premise-conclusion pairs (with re-sults 22 points above baseline), but with-out the requirement of large volumes of annotated, domain specific data.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a comparative analysis of the performance of different supervised machine learning methods and feature sets on argument mining tasks. Specifically, we address the tasks of extracting argu-mentative segments from texts and pre-dicting the structure between those seg-ments. Eight classifiers and different com-binations of six feature types reported in previous work are evaluated. The results indicate that overall best performing fea-tures are the structural ones. Although the performance of classifiers varies depend-ing on the feature combinations and cor-pora used for training and testing, Random Forest seems to be among the best per-forming classifiers. These results build a basis for further development of argument mining techniques and can guide an im-plementation of argument mining into dif-ferent applications such as argument based search.},

  abstract = {The segmentation of an argumentative text into argument units and their non-argumentative counterparts is the first step in identifying the argumentative structure of the text. Despite its importance for argument mining, unit segmentation has been approached only sporadically so far. This paper studies the major parameters of unit segmentation systematically. We ex-plore the effectiveness of various features, when capturing words separately, along with their neighbors, or even along with the entire text. Each such context is reflected by one machine learning model that we evaluate within and across three domains of texts. Among the models, our new deep learning approach capturing the entire text turns out best within all domains, with an F-score of up to 88.54. While structural fea-tures generalize best across domains, the domain transfer remains hard, which points to major challenges of unit segmentation.},

  abstract = {Automatic claim detection is a fundamen-tal argument mining task that aims to au-tomatically mine claims regarding a topic of consideration. Previous works on min-ing argumentative content have assumed that a set of relevant documents is given in advance. Here, we present a first corpus– wide claim detection framework, that can be directly applied to massive corpora. Using simple and intuitive empirical ob-servations, we derive a claim sentence query by which we are able to directly re-trieve sentences in which the prior prob-ability to include topic-relevant claims is greatly enhanced. Next, we employ simple heuristics to rank the sentences, leading to an unsupervised corpus–wide claim de-tection system, with precision that outper-forms previously reported results on the task of claim detection given relevant doc-uments and labeled data.},

Prelim-inary evaluation results suggest that topic information can be successfully used for the detection of argumentative sentences, at least for corpora used in the evaluation. Our approach has been evaluated on two English corpora, the first of which con-tains 90 persuasive essays, while the sec-ond is a collection of 340 documents from user generated content.},
