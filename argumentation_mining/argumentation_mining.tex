\section{Definiton of Argumentation Mining}

Argument(ation) Mining is the automatic identification of the argumentative
structure contained withing in a piece of language \cite{Lawrence2017}.

Argument mining is automatic extraction of arguments from natural text
\cite{Aker2017}.

\section{Tasks of Argumentation Mining}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identifying argumentative segments in text \cite{Ajjour2017, stab2017argumentative}

  \item Clustering recurring arguments \cite{boltuvzic2015identifying,
   misra2017using} 
   
  \item Recognizing argument schemes \cite{feng2011classifying}. 

  \item Prediction of structure (connecting premises to claims) \cite{Aker2017,
   Lawrence2017}

 \item Claim detection (can be similar to argument segments in text) \cite{Levy2017}. 
   Can be context dependent \cite{levy2014context} or independent \cite{lippi2015context}
   
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Identifying argumentative segments in text}

Unit segmentation consists in the splitting of a text into its
argumentative segments (ADU) and their non-argumentative counterparts.
\cite{Ajjour2017} 

\cite{persing2016end} rely on handcrafted features based on the parse tree
of a sentence to identify segments. 
\cite{stab2017argumentative} uses sequence modeling and sophisticated
features to classify the argumentativeness of each single word based on
its surrounding words. 
\cite{eger2017neural} employ a deep learning architecture using different
features based on the entire essagt
\cite{al2016news} have a rule-based where they suggest where the arguments
should be split before the actual argument annotation (annotators could
merge arguments back).
\cite{Aker2017} determine if a sentence is a claim,
premise or none. They work on a sentence boundary. 

\subsection{Prediction of structure}

\cite{Lawrence2017} have annotated debates on ``Moral Maze'' and created
argument diagrams via AIFDB. They aim to recognize the support relation
from text (inference or non-inference).
\cite{Aker2017} use claim-premise pairs and go full Carteisan on them,
making negative examples for those who aren't linked in the gold set. They
work on the \cite{stab2017parsing, aharoni2014benchmark} datasets.

\section{Unsupervised approaches to Argumentation Mining}

Lack of large datasets for argumentation mining is one of the largest
concerns of the community. 

\cite{habernal2015exploiting} try to use unsupervised features for
better argument component identification from online debate portals. 
\cite{al2016cross} apply distant supervision to automatically create
a large annotated corpus from online debate portals with argumentative and
non-argumentative segments from several domains. 
\cite{Lawrence2017} try to use web search in combination with
\emph{therefore and because} discourse indicators in addition to some
other filtering. They make their own premise-conclusion pairs by searching
the web for the discourse marker and then use LDA to predict
support/non-support relations.
\cite{Levy2017} do unsupervised claim detection where they extract
sentences with 'that' words in them and use 
them for claim detection. They acquire the sentences 
from Wikipedia (which is kind of distant supervision).
They evaluate their work through crowdsourced data labels. 

\section{Predicting support relations}

Predicting support relations is similar to textual entailment, but
involves more contextual knowledge and common-sense reasoning since the
semantic distance is greater. Also, it is not strictly a logical relation
and (with a well-defined hypothesis--text relation), but (usually) there
is a direction defined.
\cite{Lawrence2017} constructs a corpus using web-search and a gold set
then does supervised classification whether a sentence supports (infers)
another. 

\section{Cross-domain argumentation mining}

\cite{Ajjour2017} do argumentative unit segmentation on three corpuses:
Habernal's Web Discourse, Stab's Essay corpus, and Editorials to show
how cross-domain argumentative unit segmentation is a huge problem as it
is defined today and even end with open questions about how should
segmentation and argumentative units be defined.
