  abstract = {This article demontrates that we can apply deep learning to text
              understanding from character-level inputs all the way up to
              abstract text concepts, using temporal convolutional networks
              (ConvNets). We apply ConvNets to various large-scale datasets,
              including ontology classification, sentiment analysis, and text
              categorization. We show that temporal ConvNets can achieve
              astonishing performance without the knowledge of words, phrases,
              sentences and any other syntactic or semantic structures with
              regards to a human language. Evidence shows that our models can
              work for both English and Chinese.},

@article{Xiong2016,
abstract = {Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. However, due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointing decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0{\%} F1 to 75.9{\%}, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4{\%} F1.},
