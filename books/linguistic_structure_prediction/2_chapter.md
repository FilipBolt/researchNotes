# Chapter 2: Decoding: Making Predictions

## 2.1 Definitions

$\mathcal{X}$ denotes possible inputs, $\mathcal{Y}$ is a set of all possible outputs. 
For some inputs, some outputs are not feasible (same input length condition, for example).
We will use $\mathcal{Y}_x$ to subset feasible combinations. 

**Decoding** is finding the best $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ given $x \in \mathcal{X}$. 
Decoding as a term is attributed to Fred Jelinek (from information theory) and
$y$ is considered a message encoded with a representation in $x$.
